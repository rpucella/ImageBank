# ImageBank

A small project to maintain a bank of images with annotations. It fills a pretty specific need, but I'm sharing the code here in case anybody is interested or wants to use this as a starting point for a personal project.

## Build Process

To build the frontend (in the `react/` directory):

    yarn build-react

To run the server:

    yarn start-web

To build the electron app:
